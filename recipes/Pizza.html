    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>

        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over the base, sprinkle with mozzarella cheese, and add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, garnish with fresh basil if desired, slice, and serve hot!</li>
